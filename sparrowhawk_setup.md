#Sparrowhawk set up

Sparrowhawk is the open version of Google's Kestrel text normalization engine. It has several prerequisites, the following is the set up process followed from https://github.com/danijel3/SparrowhawkTest

Recommends creating a virtual environment:

    virtualenv sparrowhawk

    cd sparrowhawk

##OpenFST
  
Get and install OpenFST - we will install all packages of relevant software in /usr/local:

    wget http://www.openfst.org/twiki/pub/FST/FstDownload/openfst-1.6.3.tar.gz
    tar xvf openfst-1.6.3.tar.gz 
    cd openfst-1.6.3
 
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-far --enable-linear-fsts --enable-pdt --enable-mpdt --enable-grm
    make
    make install

##Thrax

Get and install Thrax:

    cd ..
    wget http://openfst.org/twiki/pub/GRM/ThraxDownload/thrax-1.2.3.tar.gz
    tar xvf thrax-1.2.3.tar.gz 
    cd thrax-1.2.3
	
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    make install

##RE2
	
Get and install RE2:

    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/google/re2
    cd re2/
    make

##Protobuf
	
Get and install Protobuf:

    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf

If you don't have autoconf, automake and libtools installed, needed for Protobuf:

    curl -O -L http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz
    tar -xzf autoconf-2.69.tar.gz 
    cd autoconf-2.69

    ./configure
    make
    make install

    cd ..
    curl -O -L http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/automake/automake-1.15.tar.gz
    tar -xzf automake-1.15.tar.gz 
    cd automake-1.15

    ./configure
    make
    make install
	
    cd ..
    curl -OL http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libtool/libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz
    tar -xzf libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz 
    cd libtool-2.4.6
	
    ./configure
    make
    make install
 
Continue with installing Protobuf:
  
    cd ..
    cd protobuf/
    ./autogen.sh 
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    make
    make check

Make check might show some errors, you should be able to continue anyway ...

    make install


##Sparrowhawk

And, finally, install Sparrowhawk:

    cd ..
    git clone https://github.com/google/sparrowhawk
    cd sparrowhawk/

The following is for Mac OSX, Linux users can probably just call ./configure directly:

    CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib ./configure
    make
    make install

If all the above went well, everything should be set up by now.

#### Run Sparrowhawk

First, build the demo grammars:

    cd documentation/grammars/en_toy/classify/
    thraxmakedep tokenize_and_classify.grm 
    make
    cd ..
    cd verbalize
    thraxmakedep verbalize.grm 
    make
    cd ..
    cd verbalize_serialization/
    thraxmakedep verbalize.grm 
    make

And run a test from the /grammars folder:

    cd ../..
    $HOME/sparrowhawk/src/bin/normalizer_main --config=sparrowhawk_configuration.ascii_proto --multi_line_text < test.txt > out.txt
    cat test.txt
